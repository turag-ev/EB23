code updating the storage of the enemy bot assumes
that if 3 cakes of pink color were dropped when the enmemy, 
was capacÂ´ble of making a perfect recepe ,that those 3 cakes were
cakes with the perfect recipe. This will cause a misalignment
of program to reality, if the enemy actually drops 3 pink cakes 
in one go. This is very unprobable
